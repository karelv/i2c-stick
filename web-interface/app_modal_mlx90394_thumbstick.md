# Thumbstick

This is a Human Interface Device (HID) type of application.

The thumbstick uses a magnet that moves in the X-Y plane above the sensor. The sensor detects the magnetic field in X, Y and Z direction and derives the position of the magnet in 2D space, allowing it to function similarly to a joystick for precise directional input.
  

Supported by Firmware version 1.6 and above.
