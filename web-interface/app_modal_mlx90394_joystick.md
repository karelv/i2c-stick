# Joystick

This is a Human Interface Device (HID) type of application.

A small magnet is mounted at the end of the stick inside of the joystick. As the joystick moves, the magnet changes its inclination angle above the MLX90394 sensor, which measures the magnetic field in the X, Y, and Z directions. These measurements allow the sensor to detect the position and movement by the user of the joystick.
  

Supported by Firmware version 1.6 and above.
